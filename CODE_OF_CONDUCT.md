# Omniview Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the spirit of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in Omniview and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This commitment extends to all participants, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Contributing to a positive environment involves:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Prioritizing what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit consent
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They are expected to take appropriate corrective actions in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned to this Code of Conduct. They can also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also when an individual is representing Omniview or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior can be reported to the project team at conduct@omniview.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
